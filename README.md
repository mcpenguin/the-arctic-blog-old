# Hello! Welcome to the Arctic Blog
This is my personal website. Here I post my notes for my university courses, which were handwritten on my iPad. 
Be wary of downloading/viewing them, as since all my notes are handwritten, the file sizes are substantial. Moreover, try not to print them, since I use many light colours in my notes, and these may not show if you print in grayscale/B&W.
If you have any queries, feel free to contact me through email at marcus.chanwc@gmail.com.
