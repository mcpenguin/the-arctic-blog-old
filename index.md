# Hello! Welcome to the Arctic Blog
This is my personal website. Here I post my notes for my university courses, which were handwritten on my iPad.
Be wary of downloading/viewing them, as since all my notes are handwritten, the file sizes are substantial. Moreover, try not to print them, since I use many light colours in my notes, and these may not show if you print in grayscale/B&W.
If you have any queries, feel free to contact me through email at marcus.chanwc@gmail.com.

### Sunway College (Malaysia) - Cambridge GCE A-Levels (2018 - 2020)

<p>Note: these notes were made only a few months after I acquired my iPad, and as such are slightly messy and disorganised. It might be harder to extract the relevant information from them, and it might be more difficult to revise from them.</p>
<p>Additionally, these notes follow the 2018-2020 syllabus, and were not updated to match the newer syllabuses. Thus, some information might be missing that might be needed for the current syllabuses.</p>
<p>I have also only included a selected few of my notes, as I feel many of my AS notes are too messy for publication. Moreover, I did not have ample time to procure proper notes for Physics, and thus only used an annotated version of Z-Notes when revising for my exams.</p>
